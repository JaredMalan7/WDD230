                <p>To put it simply, the riding in Utah is epic.

                <h3> Utah's Temples</h3>
                <p>In 1847, Brigham Young and the first party of Latter-day Saint (known as Mormon) emigrants reached the desolate Salt Lake Valley. Since that day, Mormon cultural and heritage has made Utah a unique place to visit, today, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints members comprise about 60 percent of the state's population. Latter-day Saints live in accordance with standards and ideals of their spiritual beliefs. The result is a state known for citizens who believe in community and family values, volunteerism, civic pride and strong sense of history. </p>
