            <p class="text-1">On this first picture we can see a great example of hierarchy in the way things are displayed when you visit lego's website.
                Note that the biggest part of this picture, and most dominant is the toy, but there are other things that draw our attention such as, 
                the "Add to the bad" button is the second most predominant, followed by the price in bigger bolded fonts the name of the toy, and "new exclusives"
                boxes on yellow. When we look at the hierarchy of the things displayed on this picture, we can clearly see what this company is all about.</p>

            <a href="https://m.zalando.co.uk/" target="blank"><h3>Zalando</h3></a>
            

            <img class="zalando-img" src="images/zalando2.jpg" alt= "filter-example">
            <p class="text-2">Zalando is an online store that sells all kinds of clothes for all kinds of tastes and people, women, men, and children.
                They sell clothes, shoes, and other items from a vast amount of known brands, for this reason I chose them as an example of what a good
                search/filter, according to Hick's Law, should be. Hick's Law is about making it easier for the user to be able to find what they are looking for.
                Having a filter as good as this one that gives you lots of options to reduce the amount of products to smaller quantity which helps the user to make quicker choices.

            <img class="apple-img" src="images/apple.jpg" height="1000" width="500" alt= "apple buy button">
            <p class="text-3">Apple's simplistic yet sharp website is great example of Fitt's Law, which about "target size".
                When we look at apple's home page, we see the iPhone 13 almost instantly, and just above the image, there is a blue "Buy" button. It's not big enough to take up
                the screen, but it's colorful and big enough to draw our attention. They do give you the option to "learn more" about it, but the letters are not as eye catching or
                attractive as the "Buy" button is.  </p>
